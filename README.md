## **Report: Implementation and Architecture**

### **1. Core Requirements Implementation**

**Features as per initial requirements:**

1. **Member Management**:
   - **Implementation**:  
     A structured database for families, where each family has a designated head and members. Includes:
     - CRUD operations for managing members.
     - Automated role reassignment (e.g., in case of the head's death, the next in line becomes head).
   - **Technology**: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM).

2. **Event Management**:
   - **Implementation**:  
     - A calendar-based venue booking system for weddings and events.
     - Availability checking and booking confirmations.
   - **Technology**: Custom API using Next.js backend routes.

3. **Administrative Features**:
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Scanning and storing documents (donation requests, meeting minutes).
     - Upload functionality integrated with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3 or Supabase Storage).
   - **Technology**: File handling with Next.js API and cloud integrations.

4. **Birthday and Anniversary Tracking**:
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Calendar view for events.
     - Automated email and SMS notifications.
   - **Technology**: SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS.

5. **Baptism Certificate Management**:
   - **Implementation**:  
     - On-demand PDF generation and storage.
   - **Technology**: Puppeteer or pdf-lib for PDF creation.

### **2. Architectural Options**

#### **A. Monolithic Architecture (Frontend + Backend in One Project)**
- **Description**: Use Next.js for both the frontend UI and backend API routes, hosted on Vercel.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simplified deployment and hosting (single repository and platform).
  - Reduced operational overhead.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Less flexible if you need to migrate backend or frontend independently.
  - Resource usage might increase as the app grows.
- **Best For**: Small-to-medium-scale apps with low-to-moderate traffic (up to ~1500 users).

#### **B. Microservices Architecture (Separate Frontend and Backend)**
- **Description**: React for the frontend hosted on Vercel, and a standalone Node.js backend hosted on Fly.io/DigitalOcean.
- **Advantages**:
  - Independent scaling for backend and frontend.
  - Better suited for integrating additional features (e.g., advanced analytics).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Increased complexity in development and deployment.
  - Higher operational costs for separate hosting.
- **Best For**: Applications expecting significant growth or modularity requirements.

#### **C. Serverless Architecture**
- **Description**: Build using Next.js with API routes running on serverless functions (Vercel) and remote PostgreSQL.
- **Advantages**:
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  - Scalable and highly available without server management.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Function cold starts can add latency.
  - Limited long-running processes.
- **Best For**: Cost-effective, low-maintenance solutions with predictable usage patterns.

### **3. Additional Features for the Future**
1. **Advanced Member Analytics**:
   - Dashboards with insights like family growth trends, donation statistics, etc.
2. **Event Payment Integration**:
   - Online payment gateway for venue booking fees or donations.
3. **Mobile App**:
   - A lightweight React Native app for members to access information and book events.
4. **Volunteer Management**:
   - Tools for scheduling and tracking church volunteer work.
5. **Live Streaming Integration**:
   - Enable live streaming of events or sermons directly within the system.

### **4. Hosting and Maintenance**
1. **Hosting**:
   - **Frontend and Backend**: Vercel (free for most use cases, scalable if traffic increases).
   - **Database**: Use Supabase or Neon for PostgreSQL hosting (free or affordable paid tiers).
2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Schedule automated backups for the database and cloud storage.
3. **Monitoring**:
   - Use tools like Sentry for error tracking and Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring.
